The Deep Learning Science team in Alexa AI invests in privacy-preserving distributed deep learning at scale, AutoML building blocks, inference optimization as well as active and weakly-supervised learning research to enable teams across Alexa address these challenges.  As a Senior Applied Scientist in the team, you will research and create models, improve models for natural language processing and speech recognition problems. You will gain hands-on experience with Amazon’s heterogeneous structured data sources; as well as large-scale computing resources to accelerate advances in training deep neural networks for natural language understanding and automatic speech recognition on massive amounts if text and speech data. The ideal candidate is clearly passionate about delivering experiences that delight customers and creating solutions that are robust.  As a Senior Applied Scientist in the team, you’ll mentor and develop other scientitsts in the team, drive cross team collaborations with partner science teams in NLU, ASR and Conversational AI organizations. You’ll also help the team and the management define the roadmap for the the science team and the sister platform team. You’ll drive science best practices across multiple team and within the organization.  Creating reliable, scalable and high performance products requires exceptional technical expertise, and a sound understanding of the fundamentals of Machine Learning. We value academic collaborations and encourage our scientists and engineers to publish in top conferences such as NIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD etc. and do open source contributions.
